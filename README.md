2. install proper requirements:
`pip3 install requests xml2dict`
3. make it executable 
`chmod +x securitas.py`

`securitas.py username password [ACTION]`

## TODO:
- Create a Home Assistant component
- Photo (CAMERA) request

## NOTES:

## OLD VERSION:
There are an old bash script command_line tool based on web API (works but its very slow).

1. Download securitas script file
2. make it executable (chmod +x securitas)
3. edit and change NICK and PASSWD (nano securitas)
4. try execute (./securitas)
5. Call it from your favorite Home Automation tool (note that inputs and outputs has been changed to be compatible with Home Assistant Alarm Component)

You can use it to automate wherever you want:
- When nobody on home > securitas armed_away 
- When all in home > securitas armed_home
- When someone enter home > securitas disarmed

EXAMPLES:

>./securitas armed_away

{"last_triggered": "10-10-2018 11:08 ", "state": "armed_away", "changed_by": "VERISURE WEB" }

>./securitas disarmed

{"last_triggered": "10-10-2018 11:09 ", "state": "disarmed", "changed_by": "VERISURE WEB" }

>./securitas log

REQUIREMENTS:
- bash, grep, awk, head (most linux distribution has all this included)
- curl (maybe you need make "sudo apt-get install curl")
- internet connection
Its supposed to run on Android with TERMUX, so you can easyly make an automation like:
- When connect to mywifi > securitas disarmed
- When disconnect from mywifi > securitas armed_away
